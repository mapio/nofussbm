No Fuss Bookmarks
=================

No Fuss Bookmarks is a very simple **software** and **service** to store
bookmarks especially designed for hackers (that don't need fancy interfaces,
but **nice API**).

The software is a simple RESTful server, written using
[Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/), providing a CRUD interface to a
[mongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/) store, plus a very basic Google Chrome
extension to submit bookmarks.

The service is just an incarnation of such software hosted by
[heroku](http://www.heroku.com/) and [mongolab](http://mongolab.com) that you
can freely use just submitting your email below to obtain your API key.

For more details, please visit the [service signup
page](http://nofussbm.herokuapp.com/signup.html).
